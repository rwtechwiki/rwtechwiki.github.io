# Crawl-Turn Wall Climb
![[crawlturnwallclimb_header.gif]]
## Description
After getting upside down and pressing forward into a wall for more than 44 ticks (with an up input pressed sometime during that time), releasing the forward input for exactly 12 ticks and then repressing it will cause slugcat to slide up the wall at an increasing speed.

## Notes
A CTWC requires* a solid 90 degree corner to be performed and so it is not possible to initiate one at the junction of a wall and a slope or a wall and a tunnel. A CTWC will be interrupted by any holes in the scaled wall.

There are several ways to get into and upside-down position to perform a CTWC, a backflip is most common but a slide stumble works well for initiating a CTWC with only 1 tile of floor as simply falling into a wall headfirst will work. 

The up input can be held for the entire duration of a CTWC, including when the forward input is released, the only criteria regarding the up input is that it must have been held for at least one tick while hugging the wall.

There is also a fast start to a Crawl-Turn Wall Climb with significantly more complex inputs that can only be performed on a one tile ledge (see Fast CTWC Start Alternate below).

\*it is possible to start a Crawl-Turn Wall Climb while sliding headfirst down a wall, without touching solid ground. However, the inputs that have led to this occurring are chaotic and not reproducible.
